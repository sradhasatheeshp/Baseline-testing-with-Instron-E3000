# Baseline-testing-with-Instron-E3000
Here, we  investigates the passive mechanical reliability of surface-mounted 1002 re sistors subjected to cyclic mechanical loading using a standardized four-point bending test  configuration. The goal is to isolate and evaluate the effect of mechanical load on soldered  components without interference from thermal or electrical variables.
